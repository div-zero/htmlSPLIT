# htmlSPLIT
Allows the user to split html files which are stored as one long string of text into their individual html segments for further use.
All that is necessary is to drag and drop the text file. Immediately the program separates the text into respective html segments and stores them back into the original file, where it is ready for use. So it is mandatory, that the file is rewritable. 
That's all.
